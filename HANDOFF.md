# HANDOFF

## Handoff Protocol

Every handoff should include:

1. Current status (`Complete`, `Partial`, or `Blocked`)
2. Exact command evidence used for verification
3. Files changed and rationale
4. Known risks and recommended next actions

Agents: append a new block below using this template after every multi-step task.

### Project Alignment + Phase Prompts + Gap Analysis
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-04-20

#### What Was Done
- Applied all 16 items from project-alignment audit (Python 3.13 upgrade, AGENTS.md rewrite, enforcement hooks, CI workflows, doc fixes, missing files).
- Created 10 phase prompt files (phases 1-10) with full versioning infrastructure.
- Applied gap analysis: added POS bigram features (Phase 4), effect size thresholds and FindingStrength enum (Phase 7), methodology appendix (Phase 8), probability features (Phase 9), AI baseline generation (Phase 10).
- Migrated Phase 10 from commercial APIs to local Ollama models.
- Added PydanticAI agent architecture and pydantic-evals quality gate to Phase 10.

#### Files Modified
- `AGENTS.md` — full rewrite with canonical sections
- `CLAUDE.md` — full rewrite with project context
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/GUARDRAILS.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/NOTES.md` — expanded
- `.claude/hooks.json` + `.claude/hooks/*.sh` — 5 enforcement hooks
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` — CI orchestrator + 3 reusable workflows + release-please
- `config.toml`, `Makefile`, `.gitattributes` — created
- `prompts/phase{1-10}/` — each with current.md, v*.md snapshots, versions.json, CHANGELOG.md

#### Verification Evidence
```
uv run ruff check . — clean
uv run ruff format --check . — clean
uv run pytest tests/ -v — 4/4 passed, 80.12% coverage
```

#### Decisions Made
- Local Ollama models (llama3.1:8b, mistral:7b, gemma2:9b) for AI baseline instead of paid APIs.
- PydanticAI agent architecture for Phase 10 generation with pydantic-evals quality gate.
- Hooks enforce code constraints only; doc updates enforced via CLAUDE.md prompt instructions.
- Phase 9 Binoculars is optional (Falcon-7B pair feasible on M1 32GB but not required).

#### Unresolved Questions
- `.claude/settings.json` still has `pythonVersion: "3.12"` — file is session-protected, needs manual update to "3.13".

#### Risks & Next Steps
- Begin implementing Phase 1 (author config) or Phase 2 (scraper discovery) — the prompt specs are ready.
- Install Ollama and pull the 3 baseline models before Phase 10 implementation.
- Consider adding `pydantic-ai` and `pydantic-evals` to pyproject.toml optional deps now.

### Phase 8 v0.3.0 — Forensic Notebook Layout + Phase 10 v0.3.0 — PydanticAI Agents
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-04-20

#### What Was Done
- Rewrote Phase 8 prompt from 7 to 10 notebooks with forensic layout rules (narrative-first, mandatory header cells, provenance metadata, Quarto book format).
- Added 3 new notebooks: 00_power_analysis (pre-registration), 02_corpus_audit (chain of custody), 08_control_comparison (confound elimination).
- Migrated Phase 10 from commercial APIs to local Ollama models (v0.2.0), then added PydanticAI agent architecture with pydantic-evals quality gate (v0.3.0).
- Fixed agent doc-update enforcement: added "Session Boundaries — REQUIRED" section to CLAUDE.md, updated AGENTS.md Definition of Done.
- Expanded RUNBOOK.md with Ollama setup, model sizes, common issues.
- Created Phase 8 v0.3.0 versioning artifacts (snapshot, versions.json, CHANGELOG.md).

#### Files Modified
- `prompts/phase8-report-and-deployment/current.md` — complete rewrite (v0.2.0 → v0.3.0)
- `prompts/phase8-report-and-deployment/v0.3.0.md` — immutable snapshot
- `prompts/phase8-report-and-deployment/versions.json` — current_version → 0.3.0, v0.2.0 superseded
- `prompts/phase8-report-and-deployment/CHANGELOG.md` — v0.3.0 entry added
- `prompts/phase10-ai-baseline-generation/current.md` — Ollama migration + PydanticAI (v0.1.0 → v0.3.0)
- `prompts/phase10-ai-baseline-generation/v0.2.0.md`, `v0.3.0.md` — immutable snapshots
- `prompts/phase10-ai-baseline-generation/versions.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` — updated
- `CLAUDE.md` — added Session Boundaries section
- `AGENTS.md` — added Always items to Definition of Done
- `HANDOFF.md` — backfilled completion blocks, added template
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — expanded with Phase 9/10 operational info

#### Decisions Made
- Local Ollama models for AI baseline instead of paid APIs.
- PydanticAI agent architecture for Phase 10 with pydantic-evals quality gate.
- Folded forensic notebook layout into Phase 8 rather than creating a separate prompt.
- Quarto `type: book` with four parts for logical chapter grouping.

#### Unresolved Questions
- `.claude/settings.json` still has `pythonVersion: "3.12"` — needs manual update to "3.13".

#### Risks & Next Steps
- All 10 phase prompts are now complete and versioned — ready to begin implementation.
- Start with Phase 1 (author config) or Phase 2 (scraper discovery).
- Install Ollama and pull models before Phase 10 implementation.

### Phase 11: Typer CLI Migration Prompt
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-04-20

#### What Was Done
- Created `prompts/phase11-typer-cli-migration/` with full versioned prompt (v0.1.0) for migrating argparse CLI to Typer.
- Inventoried complete CLI surface area across all 10 phase prompts (30+ flags).
- Designed one-file-per-subcommand package structure (`cli/__init__.py`, `_helpers.py`, `scrape.py`, `extract.py`, `analyze.py`, `report.py`).
- Pre-wired all Phase 6–10 flags as stubs so future phases don't need to restructure the CLI.
- Included complete test rewrites for Typer CliRunner.

#### Files Modified
- `prompts/phase11-typer-cli-migration/current.md` — created (v0.1.0)
- `prompts/phase11-typer-cli-migration/v0.1.0.md` — immutable snapshot
- `prompts/phase11-typer-cli-migration/versions.json` — created
- `prompts/phase11-typer-cli-migration/CHANGELOG.md` — created

#### Decisions Made
- Typer over Click (Typer wraps Click with less boilerplate and Python type annotations).
- `typer[all]>=0.15.0` includes rich for formatted help output.
- Scrape uses `add_typer()` (sub-app with `invoke_without_command=True`); other commands use `app.command()`.
- Placeholder guard raises `typer.BadParameter` instead of `ValueError`.
- Phase 11 runs after all analysis phases are built — retool the CLI as a clean-up pass.

#### Unresolved Questions
- None.

#### Risks & Next Steps
- Run Phase 11 after completing the current phase work to retool the CLI.
- The migration is backward-compatible: `pyproject.toml` entry point and `__main__.py` import path don't change.

### Phase 11 Typer CLI Migration (Implementation)
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2026-04-21
**Agent/Session:** claude/review-prompts-plan-uWhOn (Scope A)

#### What Was Done
- Replaced the single-file argparse CLI (`src/forensics/cli.py`) with a Typer package at `src/forensics/cli/` (one file per subcommand group).
- Preserved the scrape flag-combination dispatcher byte-for-byte — promoted it to a testable `_dispatch` async function.
- Pre-wired Phase 9/10 flags (`--probability`, `--no-binoculars`, `--device`, `--verify-corpus`) so later scopes only add logic.
- Wired `--verify-corpus` to call the existing `forensics.utils.provenance.verify_corpus_hash` against `data/analysis/corpus_custody.json`.
- Rewrote `tests/integration/test_cli.py` to use `typer.testing.CliRunner` and `tests/integration/test_cli_scrape_dispatch.py` to call `_dispatch` directly.
- Updated `tests/evals/test_core_eval.py` for the Typer API.
- Added `typer>=0.15.0` to core deps; added `probability` and `baseline` optional-extras.

#### Files Modified
- `src/forensics/cli.py` — deleted (replaced by package)
- `src/forensics/cli/__init__.py`, `_helpers.py`, `scrape.py`, `extract.py`, `analyze.py`, `report.py` — created
- `tests/integration/test_cli.py`, `tests/integration/test_cli_scrape_dispatch.py`, `tests/evals/test_core_eval.py` — rewritten for Typer
- `pyproject.toml` — added `typer>=0.15.0` to dependencies; added `probability` and `baseline` optional-extras
- `AGENTS.md` — CLI line argparse → Typer

#### Verification Evidence
```
uv run forensics --help       # Typer-rendered help
uv run forensics --version    # prints "forensics 0.1.0"
uv run python -m forensics --help
uv run pytest tests/ -v       # 145 passed, 15 skipped (spaCy model) — coverage 60.14%
uv run ruff check .           # All checks passed
uv run ruff format --check .  # 89 files already formatted
```

#### Decisions Made
- Kept `--openai-key` and `--llm-model` on the analyze command as deprecated — they will be removed together with the OpenAI baseline path in Scope C (Phase 10).
- `main()` returns an int so `__main__.py` keeps working unchanged; inside, it catches `SystemExit` from `app()`.

#### Unresolved Questions
- None for this scope.

#### Risks & Next Steps
- Scope B (Phase 9 probability features) builds on the wired but stubbed `--probability` / `--no-binoculars` / `--device` flags.
- Scope C (Phase 10 Ollama baseline) will wire `--ai-baseline` and `--verify-corpus` stubs and retire the OpenAI code path.
